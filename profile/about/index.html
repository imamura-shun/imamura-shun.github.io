            <p data-lang="bio-content">We obtained a Ph.D. in Science at Tohoku University and have primarily been engaged in the development of mathematical models and simulations based on the principles of physics. We developed an interest in programming through games and entered a National College of Technology. For our graduation research, we conducted simulations of passive walking models. We developed a keen interest in the phenomena of nonlinear and non-equilibrium systems, as well as the fundamental principles of physics such as variational principles, conservation laws, and symmetry. At university, we majored in physics and learned the basics of mathematical modeling to describe complex phenomena using symmetry and conservation laws. Our recent research has mainly focused on active matter (objects with self-propulsion mechanisms), from modeling their motion mechanisms to simulating their collective systems.</p>

            <p data-lang="vision-content">As participants in shaping the future, we contemplate what happiness truly means for humanity. In the current era marked by the 4th Industrial Revolution (rapid advancements in AI, cryptocurrencies, etc.), we earnestly confront energy and environmental challenges. In this VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) era, we strive to rectify issues such as poverty and inequality.</p>
