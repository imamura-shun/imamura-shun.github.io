    The vibrations born from life resonate with the waves of all matter that make up the universe.
    Vibrations (transverse and longitudinal waves) exist in all macroscopic states, such as gases, liquids, solids, and plasmas.
    Even on a microscopic level, vibrations are present in molecular lattice vibrations, electron distributions, spin vibrations of elementary particles, neutrino oscillations, and even within elementary particles and the universe, as described by superstring theory.
    These vibrations exist at all scales. (In physics, the connection between these scales is often represented by the Ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail. This symbolizes that the entire snake is vibrating with waves.)
    </p>

    <p>
        Membranes, vibrations, and waves are fascinating topics, so I encourage you to explore them further!
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, when considering vibrations, concepts like resonance, sympathetic vibration, and synchronization become incredibly interesting and important!
        (Analyzing these phenomena requires methods such as Fourier transforms using complex numbers. Specific examples include metronomes, candle flames, and the synchronization of fireflies.)
    </p>

    <p>
        Moreover, chaos, attractors, and fluctuations also play crucial roles in this context, so please investigate these concepts as well!
        (For instance, the double pendulum is a well-known example. Researching the Lorenz attractor, which is related to meteorological phenomena, can also be interesting.
        Fluctuations are noise, but in mathematics, they are deeply connected to probability and statistics, with the central limit theorem being a prime example.)
    </p>

    <p>
        These topics are often referred to as nonlinear, non-equilibrium systems and are frequently associated with the field of complex systems science.
        (In addition to the aforementioned topics, this field also encompasses life sciences and network systems such as social structures.)
    </p>

    <p>
        My current research and interest in science largely stem from learning about these themes and appreciating the complexity and beauty of nature.

        I have programmed a simulation of the behavior of a water droplet falling on a water surface. (Movie, 2D animation)
        More precisely, since the boundary conditions are fixed, it is a system where the center of a membrane stretched over a square frame is pulled, rather than a water surface. 
        (The left side represents real space, and the right side represents reciprocal space.)

    <p>
        There are various discussions about existence. In terms of waves, if we are all waves, there must be something to cancel them out, which is said to exist in another world line, such as antimatter. An experimental art piece demonstrating this concept is the interference and reflection of waves within a 3D box. (Movie, 3D animation)
